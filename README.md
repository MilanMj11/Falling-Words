# Falling Words: A Challenging Typing Game

## Overview

Welcome to Falling Words, a typing game designed to enhance your keyboard skills while providing
an enjoyable and challenging gaming experience. Developed in C++ with the SFML library, Falling Words offers
multiple game modes for various skill levels, ensuring both beginners and experienced typists can find a 
challenge that suits them.

## Game Modes

### 1. Survival Mode

Test your limits in Survival Mode, where the pace of the game continually accelerates. Type words as fast
as you can, and strive to survive against the relentless speed. How long can you endure the escalating challenge? 
Your survival time is the ultimate measure of your typing prowess.

### 2. Easy, Medium, Hard and Expert Modes

For those who prefer a structured challenge, Falling Words introduces difficulty levels with 
Easy, Medium, Hard and Expert Modes. The difference lies in the Words Per Minute (WPM) requirements, 
with each level building upon the last. Unlike Survival Mode, these modes remain constant in speed and 
focus on accuracy and the ability to build a high Combo in order to obtain more Points.

## Combo System

The game incorporates a Combo System that rewards accuracy and consecutive correct typings of the falling words. 
The higher the Combo, the more points you accumulate. Keeping the streak alive helps to maximize the final score.

## Hearts System

Each game mode begins with three Hearts, representing the number of words you can miss before the game ends. 
Missing a word results in decreasing the number of Hearts you have, and eventually leads to losing the game. 
Strategic typing and accuracy are crucial for maintaining yourself alive throughout the challenges.

## Final Stats

Falling Words provides you with live Stats during each challenge, such as "Points/Score", "Accuracy", "Words per minute" and "Rank", 
and also a quick summary at the end of each game played, where you can see how good you performed.

## Personal Best

The game features a High Score system that allows you to track your best Scores / Times and showcase your typing achievements. 
With local saves preserving every score obtained for each game mode, you can close the game without worrying of losing your 
previous times, as they are all saved in game files, and the best scores are also displayed in the Main Menu.

## How to Play

Initially the game brings you to the Main Menu where you see all the game modes you can choose from.

1. Choose your preferred game mode from the user-friendly menu.
2. Type the falling words before they reach the bottom of the screen.
3. Maintain accuracy to increase your Combo and Score.
4. Keep an eye on your Hearts. Running out means losing the game.

At any time you feel like taking a break, you may Pause the game by pressing "Esc" or pressing the Pause Button in the up-right 
corner of the Window. You may also restart the game if you feel like you performed bad by Pausing and then pressing the Restart button.
